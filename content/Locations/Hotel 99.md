Hotel 99 is a modest motel on the outskirts of the 9th District Ghetto. Couple of miles off of the paramilitary checkpoint guarding the walls of Seattle from the horrors found outside in the Khanid Wasteland. 

That is to say, it's in backass-nowhere, far out of any peacekeeping stations, you probably would sooner see a corpo give money to charity out of the goodness of their heart, than to have Lonestar pick your ass up in-case of a break-in. As it normally is, with these motels. Large part of the clientele are nomads, going from one city or another stopping by for a supply run; or idiots who do the same but unprepared. 

It offers free-range parking and the normal and standard privacy considerations you could expect: polarised windows, cheap noise wallpapers and basic soundproofing on paper-thin, cheap, fourth-grade Aeroplast walls. At the surprise of absolutely no one, -- largely due to its location -- it's deep in roadgangers territory
